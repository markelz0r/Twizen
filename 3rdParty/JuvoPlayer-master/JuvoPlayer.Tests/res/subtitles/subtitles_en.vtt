But now back to the movie...

24
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.500
This blade has a dark past.

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800
It has shed much innocent blood.

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

27
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

28
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.300
Thank you.

29
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
So...

30
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm searching for someone.

32
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

33
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.000
A dragon.

34
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

35
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

36
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.500
We're almost done. Shhh...

37
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.500
Hey, sit still.

38
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.250
Good night, Scales.

39
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

40
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.250
Scales?

41
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.500
Yeah! Come on!

42
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.000
Scales!

43
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.500
I have failed.

44
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.500
You've only failed to see...

45
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

46
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.000
You are closer than you know.

47
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.500
Scales!

48
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.000
Scales?

49
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.800
Scales...
